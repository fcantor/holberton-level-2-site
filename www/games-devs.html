						<h2>The Best of the Best</h2>
						<p>Some of the best games are made on smaller budgets. If you haven't played any indie games before, here are 5 must-play games and their developers, featured on top gaming news sites and are nominees and winners at the <a href="http://igf.com/article/2018-independent-games-festival-announces-main-competition-finalists">Independent Games Festival</a>.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>Exploring a surreal wilderness seems like quite the trend these days in gaming, and developer Campo Santo's debut only serves to keep it going strong. Set in the wilderness of 1989 Wyoming, you're Henry, a fire lookout that's all alone in the woods after exploring something strange in the distance.</p>

						<p>That is, save for your partner on the other line of a walkie-talkie: Delilah. She's your only point of contact as you explore the wilderness. Will you make it back alive? Will the decisions you make help or harm the relationship with your only lifeline to the outside world, your boss? Don't worry about those questions just yet – just look at those forestscapes!</p>

						<h3><a href="http://www.playdead.com/games/inside/">Inside</a></h3>

						</figure>
						<p>From developer <a href="http://www.playdead.com/">Playdead</a>, Inside is comparable to its predecessor, <a href="http://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/">Limbo</a>, in some ways but with an added layer of depth that inspires frequent wonder. This is mostly a result of the unspoken narrative, which revolves around yet another nameless boy. In Inside, however, the boy in the story is running away from a group of men who – if you fail to stay out of their sights – will try to mercilessly kill you.</p>

						<p>Though it isn't quite clear why the boy is running from these men or why you should even care since you don't know who he is, Inside will leave you begging for answers. The bleak, lifeless setting of Inside is more than worth the price of admission. Its minimalist art style alone is avant-garde enough to feel right at home in a museum. Add in a game that's both fun to play and dripping with curiosity, though, and Inside is one of the best indie games money can buy.</p>

						<p>From Canadian game developers <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/infinite-fall/3010-9499/">Infinite Fall</a>, Night in the Woods is an unconventional side-scrolling adventure game centering around a 20-year-old protagonist named Mae who drops out of college to move back in with her parents.</p> 

						<p>Featuring a story largely based around dialog choices and mini games that put a spin on mundane tasks like carrying boxes up the stairs and eating perogies, Night in the Woods is a timeless coming-of-age tale. Not only will you get to experience middle class America through the eyes of a personified cat, but virtually every interaction in-game will have you laughing aloud.</p>

						<p>Most mainstream games are escapist power fantasies, where the player grows their capabilities until they dominate the game's universe - and then the game ends. Yet many indie games are dis-empowerment fantasies - like the IGF award winner and misery sim <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/cart-life/3030-36155/">Cart Life</a>.</p>

						<p>Papers Please is similar to Cart Life - it's also an IGF winner with elements of misery about it - but it's better, being a smart, weird sim about the compromised life of a border guard under a totalitarian regime. It's ugly and desperate, but also innovative, uproariously funny and terribly smart.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>Developed single-handedly by <a href="https://twitter.com/concernedape">Eric Barone</a>, Stardew Valley is undoubtedly a technical feat for that little facet alone. If you’ve ever played a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)">Harvest Moon</a> game, you’re already familiar with the premise of Stardew Valley – you may just not know it yet. Stardew Valley is an addictive farming simulator which sees you interact with townees to the point where you can literally marry them.</p>

						<p>Stardew Valley isn’t just one thing; it’s a whole bunch of things at once. You can engage in crafting, fishing, cooking and even exploring procedurally-generated caves to mine for items and even take on monstrous enemies. However, do keep in mind your health and energy as you’ll need to make sure your character is in tip-top shape in order to avoid suffering from exhaustion. Lose health and you lose a considerable amount of money and items you’ve worked hard to attained. Stardew Valley will have you hooked for hours on end, for better or worse. (Better, definitely better.)</p>
