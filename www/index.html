						<p>An <strong>independent video game</strong> (commonly referred to as an indie game) is a video game that is often created without the financial support of a publisher, although some games funded by a publisher are still considered "indie". Indie games often focus on innovation and rely on digital distribution. Indie games are developed by individuals, small teams, or small independent companies; companies that are often specifically formed for the development of one specific game. Typically, indie games are smaller than mainstream titles. Indie game developers are generally not financially backed by video game publishers (who are risk-averse and prefer big-budget games) and usually have little to no budget available.</p>

						<h2>History & Development</h2>
						<p>The onset of indie game development is difficult to track due to the broadness of what constitutes the definition of an indie game, and terms like "indie game" were not really in use until around 1999â€“2004. Indie gaming saw a rise in mainstream popularity in the latter half of the 2000s, primarily due to new online distribution methods and development tools.</p> 
					</div>
					<div class="content-3">
						<p>In order to fund the game, developers can rely on starting a crowd-funding campaign (e.g. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a>, etc.), finding a publisher, or building community support while in development (e.g. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, etc.). Without publisher support, developers generally rely on Internet digital distribution options. Most indie games do not make significant profit.</p>

						<p><q>"Indie game development should not be confused with hobbyist game development, as indie developers are generally more product-oriented than hobbyist game creators."</q></p> 
						<p>Many hobbyist developers create mods of existing games, or work with specific technologies or game parts. Such hobbyists usually produce non-commercial products and may range from novices to industry veterans.</p> 
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<p><strong>C++</strong> is a popular language of choice within the video game industry, partly due to its low-level efficient nature, but mostly because almost all popular 3D game engines are already written in C++. However, independent video games have seen use of a variety of other languages. Notably, <strong>C#</strong>, the language for XNA (Microsoft's toolkit that facilitates video game development on the Xbox 360, Windows Phone 7 and Windows PCs) and <strong>Objective-C</strong>, the language for the iPhone's Cocoa touch API, the popularity of which has grown greatly since 2008, due to the accessibility of the App Store to independent developers. Indie games written in <strong>Java</strong> are also prevalent, due to the wide compatibility for most operating systems and web browsers. Other dynamic languages, notably <strong>Python, Ruby, Lua</strong> and <strong>ActionScript</strong> have also found their way into the scene, lowering barriers of entry to game development. Also the growing ecosystem of open source libraries and engines in the 2000s is utilized by the indie developers due to good cross platform capabilities and often limited or no license fees.</p>

						<h2>Community</h2>
						<p>Indie game developers can be involved with various indie game trade shows such as <a href="http://www.igf.com/">Independent Games Festival</a> and <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/">IndieCade.</a></p> 
						<p><a href="http://indiegamejam.com/">Indie Game Jam (IGJ)</a> is an annual event that allows indie game developers to experiment and present ideas without publisher restrictions. IGJ was founded by Chris Hecker and Sean Barrett and first held in March 2002. Each year IGJ poses different questions about innovation in settings, genres, and controls. The IGJ was considered an inspiration for later game jams, including the <a href="https://nordicgamejam.org/">Nordic Game Jam</a> and the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam (GGJ)</a>, which was first held in 2009 with 1650 participants at 53 locations.</p>
